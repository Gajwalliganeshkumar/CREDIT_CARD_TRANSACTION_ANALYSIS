# DAX measures used in the Power BI  Project for credit card transaction analysis.

 1.  Total_Spend = SUM(TransactionData[Amount])
 2.  Total_Transactions = COUNT(TransactionData[TransactionID])
 3.  Total_Transactions = COUNT(TransactionData[TransactionID])

We Can Also use Measures like,

Monthly_Spend = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(TransactionData[Amount]),
    ALLEXCEPT(TransactionData, TransactionData[Month])) Aggregates total spend for each calendar month.



Category_Spend = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(TransactionData[Amount]),
    ALLEXCEPT(TransactionData, TransactionData[Category])).Returns total spend for each transaction category (e.g., Shop Online, Entertainment, etc.)


Category_Spend_Percent = 
DIVIDE(
    [Category_Spend],
    [Total_Spend],
    0).
